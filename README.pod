=head1 NAME

Win32::Pipe::PP - Pure Perl replacement for Win32::Pipe using Win32::API

=head1 OVERVIEW

This module provides a pure Perl implementation of L<Win32::Pipe>, 
using L<Win32::API> to bind directly to native Windows system calls. It is 
designed as a drop-in replacement for the original XS-based module, with API 
compatibility and improved maintainability.

=head1 GOALS

=over

=item * Eliminate XS dependency for easier installation and portability

=item * Provide full API compatibility with Win32::Pipe

=item * Support IPC integration via C<get_Win32_IPC_HANDLE>

=item * Enable modular testing and extensibility

=back

=head1 DIFFERENCES

=over

=item * No XS or compiled components - implemented entirely in Perl

=item * Message mode and advanced flags are simplified or stubbed

=item * Overlapped I/O is not yet supported

=back

=head1 IMPROVEMENTS

=over

=item * C<Read()> handles ERROR_MORE_DATA correctly and returns complete data

=item * Consistent error reporting via C<Error()>

=item * IPC compatibility without inheritance - via C<get_Win32_IPC_HANDLE>

=item * Clean separation of pipe handle and metadata for event loops
